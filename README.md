# Pull To Refresh for Jetpack Compose

A library provides a layout to the pull-to-refresh UX Pattern.
This project is inspired by one of Google extension libraries for Jetpack Compose, called  [SwipeRefresh](https://google.github.io/accompanist/swiperefresh/).
The concept of scrolling the content are absolutely the same. However, instead of showing just a progressbar indicator from the top to the bottom while the
content itself being scrolled down, the layout would show an additional customizable layouts that correspond to the refresh state. This layout could be an indicator,
an animation, or just text to show. It's totally customizable.
